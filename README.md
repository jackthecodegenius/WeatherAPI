The UptownIT REST API is a scalable, secure application built with C# and ASP.NET Core, designed to manage climate data collected from sensors across Queensland. It utilizes MongoDB for flexible, schema-less data storage, allowing efficient handling of large datasets with features like indexing and sharding for scalability. The API supports CRUD operations for weather data and user management, offering role-based access control for teachers, students, and sensors. Data is exchanged in JSON format, secured via HTTPS, and authenticated with API keys.
